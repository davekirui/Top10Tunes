			<p>This app is an online version of my book of music lists, DJ Pascoe's Top 10 Tunes. It is </p>
			<p>aimed at DJs, and other people who love and are interested in music, and it is designed </p>
			<p>to give you easy access to ideas about particular tracks to play or talk about across a </p>
			<p>wide range of musical genres.</p>
			<p>Each top ten is based on a combination of the &quot;must play lists I always ask my clients to </p>
			<p>provide, the most popular requests I have received while djing over the years, my own </p>
			<p>personal likes, and the views of some of my music loving friends and fellow DJs. The </p>
			<p>tracks I selected for my top tens are, in general, more &quot;populist&quot; than &quot;purist&quot;. I'm not </p>
			<p>saying they are the &quot;best&quot; in any of the given categories, just that they are the ones that </p>
			<p>most people seem to like.....in my experience.</p>
			<p>Almost all of the tracks listed here have a live link to their Youtube video, so you can </p>
			<p>check them out for yourself, and new lists will be added on a regular basis.</p>
			<p>The main purpose of these lists is to help to DJs to find those magic combinations of </p>
			<p>music that will make a party swing, no matter the circumstances or the makeup of the </p>
			<p>crowd on the dance floor. I also hope they will generate lots of healthy discussion and </p>
			<p>debate about music. You are ENCOURAGED to become a part of this conversation by </p>
			<p>checking out the Top Ten Tunes website at www.top10tunes.co.uk and sharingu989= YOUR </p>
			<p>top 10 lists, or your view on where you think a particular song should be rated. Help me </p>
	    <p>build a MASSIVE database which will be the go-to reference point for DJs and party </p>
		  <p>people from all over the world who are looking to engage with new kinds of music.</p>
